# Why is this?
This site exists as my attempt at a [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I like to create. I have many ideas but I tend to spend longer thinking about what *could be* before actually putting the ideas down and then... It never happens.
# How is this?
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) really appeals to me as tool for generating a collection of potentially unrelated concepts that later turn out to have emergent relations, so that's what I'm using to create and log my notes.
[Quartz](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/How+to+publish+Obsidian+notes+with+Quartz+on+GitHub+Pages) then takes that vault and syncs it up to a [Github Repository](https://github.com/kryptykphysh/physhbowl) that has a Github Action to publish the branch as a Github Page.
Which is nice.

I've played RPGs since I just got in to double digits in years, starting with Tunnels & Trolls and the Dungeons & Dragons Red Box Basic Set.
These days, I collect more games than I play, but that's not for the lack of trying! Most of the time, the problem is trying to get up to half a dozen adult humans with the same four or so hours free in any given week. That said, at the minute I'm playing in a few games: The Triangle Agency, Call of Cthulhu (Masks of Nyarlathotep) and Gothic Dark (a hack of Cthulhu Dark. Less tentacles more velvet). I am also in negotiations to open and run a live and in the flesh session of [[The Magnus Archives]].

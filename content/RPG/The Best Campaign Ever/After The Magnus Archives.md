> [!question]- Spoilers for the podcast.
> When the original series ends, the [[Entities]] are released in to an unknown number of realities, with the statements and recordings made by the original institute serving as, "seeds," for the [[Entities]].

Given that our campaign is going to be following on from the events of the original podcast, we're going to be taking a leaf out of [The Magnus Protocol's](https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-protocol/) book. In *this* world, the Magnus Institute, London, existed.
# What happened to the Magnus Institute?
# What took up the Archives afterwards?
# Are new statements being taken?
Yes.
I definitely want players to be coming up with statements as they get more involved.

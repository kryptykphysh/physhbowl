> [!question]- Spoilers for the podcast.
> When the original series ends, the [[Entities]] are released in to an unknown number of realities, with the statements and recordings made by the original institute serving as, "seeds," for the [[Entities]].

Given that our campaign is going to be following on from the events of the original podcast, we're going to be taking a leaf out of [The Magnus Protocol's](https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-protocol/) book. In *this* world, the Magnus Institute, London, existed.
# What happened to the Magnus Institute?
Honestly, I don't think this is something that needs to be elaborated on too much at this stage. There used to be an organisation called *the Magnus Institute* that gathered and investigated occurrences of, "the weird". Now, there isn't. No, we don't have any further information on that for you right now. Carry on with your work, do.
# What took up the Archives afterwards?
I like the idea of some crappy UK government civil service/intelligence agency taking up the reins. Something like [The Laundry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laundry_Files) but even less well funded and effective. Something let, "go to seed".
# Are new statements being taken?
Yes.
I definitely want players to be coming up with statements as they get more involved.

> _"Imagine you are an ant, and you have never before seen a human. Then one day, into your colony, a huge fingernail is thrust, scraping and digging. You flee to another entrance, only to be confronted by a staring eye gazing at you. You climb to the top, trying to find escape, and above, you can see the vast, dark shadow of a boot falling upon you. Would that ant be able to construct these things into the form of a single human being? Or would it believe itself to be under attack by three different, equally terrible, but very distinct assailants?"

[[The Entities]], also called the **Fears**, the **Powers**, the **Dread Powers**, and **The Things That Were Fear** are the principle antagonists of The Magnus Archives, and the phenomena that more mundane and earthly antagonists serve.

They are various aspects of an amorphous force of fear that exists next to reality. They are variously also referred to as "Gods", "powers", or simply as "the Fears". Their influence upon reality manifests as supernatural happenings — all supernatural phenomena in the world are simply extensions of them. These phenomena can take various forms such as people, animals, monsters, books, objects, or places, all with the goal of evoking fear, terror, and paranoia from all who encounter them.

These entities do not simply feed off of fear but are fears made manifest. It is not only human fear that counts but that of animals as well, particularly for The Flesh and The Hunt. The more fearful the world is of a certain thing, the more powerful the related entity becomes, becoming empowered by the increased fear of its realm of influence.

# Origins and Nature

Originally there was only one entity, implied to be (or least survive as) [[The Hunt]]. This entity existed before humans, and fed on animal fears.

As humans evolved and began to develop language and complex thoughts, they began to tear it apart into smaller and more specific fears, causing the current multiple entities to exist. As these new entities grew and fought among each other, they felt the urge to enter our world and "become one with the minds below". They received the opportunity to do this with the first [[avatars]], who opened the first connection between their realm and ours. And from that they gained the ability to influence our world.

Most entities are near mindless; unable to conceptualize time or themselves and motivated purely by their desire to feed on fear and enter our world. The two exceptions are [[The Web]] and [[The End]]. They are at least sentient enough to make complex long term plans to escape this universe and to destroy reality, respectively.

# Entities

> _“Like colours, but if colours hated me.”_  
> - [[Jonathan Sims]], Head Archivist of The Magnus Institute, London, [[MAG 111]]

## Smirke's List
[[Robert Smirke]] categorised all the disparate entities into 14 main categories. Each Entity is comprised of a variety of smaller terrors, some direct, some abstract, and some tend to bleed over between one Entity and the next. Whilst fears do change and are subject to place, time, and culture, they are thought to have remained fairly stable since the industrial revolution, though an entity's power fluctuates with the world's fear of their domain. Each entity has a variety of names, though Smirke's names are generally the most commonly used.

These classifications are much like colours, infinite fears that can be grouped into a few categories — each entity can be separated to some degree, but the fears bleed and feed into one another around the edges, and within each entity are different shades of the same hue. This also works to explain why some entities oppose one another, their colours "clash" like red and green or blue and orange.

## Dekker's Addendum

- Also called The Terrible Change, The Future Without Us, The World Is Always Ending.
- A new entity hypothesized by [Adelard Dekker](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/Adelard_Dekker "Adelard Dekker") to be currently emerging. As of [MAG 175](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/MAG_175:_Epoch "MAG 175: Epoch"), it is confirmed to exist, although whether it is on the same level as the other Entities or the existential threat Dekker feared remains unclear.
- The fear of catastrophic change, destruction of nature, destruction of human skin and tissue, the destruction of humanity itself and its replacement by something different; all of this especially via mankind's own causing.
- Manifests through human technology such as computers, code, and radio, and seems to present horrifying visions of what humans could become, or what could become of humans.
- Most avatars agree that they would like to prevent The Extinction from emerging if possible.

## Manifestations

### Animals

Aspects of The Entities can appear as animals, such as the Monster Pig or Agape the dog. It is unclear if Monster Pig is a manifestation or an instance of an animal becoming an avatar.

### Artefacts

The Entities can manifest as a variety of objects possessing anomalous properties (such as a [table](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/Web_Table "Web Table"), a [coffin](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/The_Coffin "The Coffin"), etc). They frequently manifest as [books](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_books "List of books"), which are said to represent the Entities in a "purer" form.

### Locations

People can slip into a form of extra-dimensional space when influenced by a Fear. These spaces do not function under regular logic and the passage of time can also be distorted. These spaces can be delineated by a threshold or simply manifest spontaneously around a person. Escape can be achieved by physically exiting the manifestation, or by a change in the person’s mental or emotional state. Examples include:

- The abattoir in [MAG 30](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/MAG_30:_Killing_Floor "MAG 30: Killing Floor")
- The old part of town in [MAG 48](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/MAG_48:_Lost_in_the_Crowd "MAG 48: Lost in the Crowd")
- The coffin in [MAG 132](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/MAG_132:_Entombed "MAG 132: Entombed")
- The cul-de-sac in [MAG 150](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/MAG_150:_Cul-De-Sac "MAG 150: Cul-De-Sac")
- The amusement park in [MAG 156](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/MAG_156:_Reflection "MAG 156: Reflection")

### People

Some humans can become attached to an Entity and become empowered by it, gaining supernatural abilities related to their patron but losing some or all of their humanity in the process. They are referred to as [avatars](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/Avatars "Avatars"). Avatars usually have mentalities reflective of their patron.

Avatars retain their agency but become physically dependent on their patron, suffering withdrawal effects, including death, if they go too long without feeding the entity that empowers them.

A death is required for someone to become a fully realized avatar but it can be literal or metaphysical in nature. Fledgling avatars can still have powers, but fully realized avatars are significantly more powerful. Eventually, most avatars will become unable to die or be harmed by conventional means, requiring something specific to their nature, or a Hunter, to kill them.

### Other

Some beings, such as the [NotThem](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/NotThem "NotThem"), vampires, etc, possess human qualities but it is unclear if they were ever human. Sometimes they consist in part of a human, such as [The Distortion](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/The_Distortion "The Distortion") after it was combined with [Michael Shelley](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Shelley "Michael Shelley"). Sometimes they appear completely inhuman, like [The Still And Lightless Beast](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/The_Still_And_Lightless_Beast "The Still And Lightless Beast") and [The Lichtenberg Figure](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Crew "Michael Crew").

## Rituals

Most entities have their own ‘[ritual](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/Rituals "Rituals")’, a symbolic act that, if completed, will allow the entity to merge with reality, changing the fabric of the world as it exerts its will and nature upon that reality. These rituals have the potential to bring other closely-tied entities along with it. It requires centuries for each Entity to build up the power needed for its ritual, and if it is stopped, it cannot try again until it rebuilds that power base. No ritual had ever succeeded as of [MAG 159](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/MAG_159:_The_Last "MAG 159: The Last").

In [MAG 160](https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/MAG_160:_The_Eye_Opens "MAG 160: The Eye Opens"), Jonah Magnus reveals why: The entities are too closely connected to be summoned individually; they cannot be fully separated from each other due to overlap and opposing binaries. For example, the line between the Spiral and the Stranger can be blurred, and a world with only the Buried cannot exist because the Buried needs the contrast of open spaces to exist. A ritual attempting to summon a single entity will inevitably collapse under its weight. The only way to successfully complete a ritual is to summon every entity at once.

Jonah Magnus devises such a ritual using Jonathan Sims as a lynchpin. After being marked by every entity in his role as Archivist, he is made to recite an incantation to "open the door" and summon every entity at once. The reason an Archivist is needed for the ritual is that the Archivist functions as a _living_ _archive_, not only recording events but embodying them. The power of events that involve the Archivist being marked by each of the Entities is enough to summon them, while also not splitting them up.

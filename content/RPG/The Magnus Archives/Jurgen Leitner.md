Jurgen Leitner is best known for his library of [[List of Books|occult books]], all of which are identifiable via the interior bookplate that reads "From The Library of Jurgen Leitner". He was a Norwegian-born recluse, well-known in literary (specifically rare book collecting) circles in the 1990s. Upon discovering the existence of the supernatural, he set about collecting books in an attempt to protect the world from their effects. It was rumoured that he would custom bind known books or pay authors to write for him.

He went into hiding after the destruction of his library in 1994 and eventually came to reside in the [[Millbank Prison]] tunnels beneath [[The Magnus Institute]].

# The Library of Jurgen Leitner

The library was destroyed in 1994. Its design was drawn from the writings and architecture of [[Robert Smirke]], with sections uniquely designed to hold their "prisoners". Leitner later described all "defences" as pointing inward, making breaking in from the outside almost trivial.

It was known for having books on demonology or the arcane. At its height, the library contained 978 books (MAG 80).

## Known books

_For the full list of books mentioned in the series, see [[List of Books]]_.

- _[[Ex Altiora]]_

- _[[The Key of Solomon]], owned by [[MacGregor Mathers]] and Jurgen Leitner_ - a book on demonology found on eBay. The buyer, _grbookworm1818_, is later revealed to be [[Gertrude Robinson]]. It was destroyed by [[Gertrude Robinson|Robinson]] and Leitner in the tunnels beneath the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]]. It is notable as being one of the few books "marked by several powers".

## Possible books

- _[[The Tale of a Field Hospital]]_ - though it once possessed a library sticker, it was mostly torn off.
- _Dig_ - there was a label at the front, but the book had been wet and the ink on it had run.
- 蜘蛛が食べている (_kumo ga tabete iru) -_ the statement-giver who finds the book makes a threatening reference to the previous owner of the book, whom [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] assumes to be Leitner.
- Tecton multicamera recorder manual - the statement-giver mentions that someone had put their name in the front of the manual.
- An old paperback book - capable of driving an entire village to slaughter each other by any means necessary. It is covered in blood and the cover is unreadable, inside, every single page is blank.
- Old crumbling book with no library markings - All the pages appear blank but [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] sees them with faces on them in his dreams. Allan tells [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] that something without eyes "saw him" though the pages and seemed to have hunted him down, killed him, and stolen his eyes after reading it.

# Trivia

- Leitner is voiced by the father of writer Jonathan Sims.
- The fake last name used for him "Icarus" is most likely a reference to how he fell to ruin due to his belief that he could control his library like Icarus flying too close to the sun.

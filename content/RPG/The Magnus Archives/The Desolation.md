*Entity inspired Tarot by Grace Holsten*

> _"Fear of pain, fear of loss, fear of unthinking or cruel destruction."  
> - [[Gerard Keay]], [[MAG 111]]_

The Desolation is one of [[The Entities]]. It is a manifestation of pain and loss: "all of the worst parts of fire, with none of the warmth." [[Jude Perry]] calls it "a reckoning, a surging tide of destruction and pain" and "blackened earth, the destructive agonizing heat of burning flesh and land scoured of life, the light with the comfort of fire stripped from it, leaving nothing but the terror of its approach."

The Desolation is worshipped by [[The Cult of the Lightless Flame]]. Cult members are enriched by destroying the lives of people who had reasons to live and destroying things before their potential is realized. In exchange, the cult members can create extreme heat, but not fire, and gain the ability to manipulate skin as if it were wax.

# Characters

- [[The Cult of the Lightless Flame]]
    - [[Agnes Montague]]: Messiah of the Lightless Flame, brought into the world as part of The Desolation's ritual.
    - [[Jude Perry]]: Acolyte of the Lightless Flame and one of the newer members of the cult
    - [[Diego Molina]]: High ranking member of the cult, referred to The Desolation as 'Asag'
    - [[Arthur Nolan]]: Former head of the cult, demoted after Agnes' death.
    - [[Eugene Vanderstock]]: A "thoroughly unpleasant little man," 'killed' by [[Gertrude Robinson]]
    - [[Eileen Montague]]: Mother of [[Agnes Montague]], died in childbirth.

# Locations

- Jude Perry's [[Domains|domain]] in the post-[[The Change|Change]] world: A building that constantly burns, with families trapped within, unable to escape. Arthur Nolan was noted to exist within this building.
- [[The Furnace]]([[MAG 179: Accomplice]]) A Desolation aligned domain in the post-[[The Change|Change]] world where inhabitants are forced to shovel carts full of the things they love into a furnace.

# Ritual

The Desolation's ritual involved the creation of [[Agnes Montague]] as a messiah and incarnation of flame that was to bring about "The Scoured Earth”. She became temporarily unable to fulfil the ritual when the Web bound her to [[Gertrude Robinson]]. [[The Cult of the Lightless Flame]], fearing that a violent death would also harm [[Agnes Montague|Agnes]], decided to wait for [[Gertrude Robinson|Gertrude]] to die of old age.

In 2006 [[Agnes Montague|Agnes]] was afflicted with doubt and realized she may be unable to complete the ritual. Rather than attempting it, leading to centuries of waiting before it could be attempted again, [[Agnes Montague|Agnes]] decided to die a cold and quiet death. She hoped her spark would return to the [[The Cult of the Lightless Flame|Lightless Flame]] and allow for a new ritual attempt much sooner.

# Connections with other Entities

- [[Jude Perry]] worked with [[The Stranger]] to burn down Gwydir Forest in Wales in 2014.
- [[The Lonely]], The Desolation, and [[The Dark]] are all associated with cults. The [[Lukas Family]] are described by [[Evan Lukas]] as very "religious," The Desolation has [[The Cult of the Lightless Flame]], and [[The Dark]] has [[The People's Church of the Divine Host]].
- After losing his leadership position in [[The Cult of the Lightless Flame]], [[Arthur Nolan]] discovers a nest of the [[The Corruption|Corruption]]. He ultimately burns the nest by immolating himself.
- The Desolation and [[The Web]] seem to have an antagonistic relationship.
    - When [[Gertrude Robinson]] discovered and attempted to counter the Desolation's ritual, [[The Web]] metaphysically bound her to [[Agnes Montague]], thus stalling their ritual.
    - [[Agnes montague|Agnes]] was placed under the care of [[Raymond Fielding]] at [[Hill Top Road]]. While there she thwarts [[Raymond Fielding|Raymond's]] attempt to trap [[Ronald Sinclair]] and eventually burns the house down.
    - While the house is still strongly connected to [[The Web]], The Desolation seems to have also left its mark on the place.
    - In [[MAG 196: This Old House]], [[The Web]] seems displeased that [[Agnes Montague|Agnes]] burnt down [[Hill Top Road]].
    - In [[MAG 67: Burning Desire]], [[Agnes Montague|Agnes]] burns a cobweb, and another agent of The Desolation held a box filled with spiders.
    - In [[MAG 147: Weaver]], [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]] mentions that [[The Web]] "doesn't get on great with fire", according to [[Jonathan Sims|John]], hence why they used magnesium flares when searching [[Hill Top Road]].

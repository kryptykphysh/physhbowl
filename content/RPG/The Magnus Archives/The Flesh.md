> _"Everything feels afraid sometimes. Sure, maybe it's not as complicated or existential as our fear, but it's real. And there's what, twenty billion chickens in the world? A few billion pigs, cows. How many of them are dying of old age? All that terror, it has to go somewhere. So it does."  
> "And when something formed out of an animalistic fear of the slaughterhouse reaches out to people-"  
> "Things get weird. Yeah. It gets mixed all up with human neuroses. Bodies, gore, y'know, that nagging worry that deep down we're just electrified meat squeezing air at each other."  
> - [[Gerard Keay]] and [[Jonathan Sims]], [[MAG 111]]_

The Flesh is one of the [[Entities]]. It is the fear of mutilation and having your body changed or destroyed as well the animal fear of being slaughtered for meat. It is also connected to insecurity and self-hatred, specifically regarding one's own body image.

It is thought to be the newest of the entities, born from the fear created by the increase in the industrial farming of animals for meat. In humans, it manifests as bodies, bones, muscles and flesh being twisted, reshaped, and butchered, it also employs the thought of being nothing more than meat. It often employs Christian imagery, such as a cannibalistic version of Eucharist and using a Gnostic church as a ritual site.

> _"The Spiral is the fear of madness, right? That worry that your world isn't right, that your mind is lying to you."  
> - [[Jonathan Sims]], [[MAG 111]]_

The Spiral is one of [[The Entities]]. It is based on the fear of madness, that your world isn’t right, that your mind is lying to you. It deals with deception, lying, deceiving the mind and senses.

The Spiral is associated with fractal patterns, hallucinations, doubt of sanity, impossible geometry, maddening realms and dimensions, doors and mazes.

# Characters

- [[The Distortion]]: An avatar of The Spiral that frequently appears to those at [[The Magnus Institute]], [[The Distortion]] describes themself as "a door that would open to all the places that were never there." They take the form of a door and can appear anywhere they wish, including underneath solid surfaces, standing alone with no attached structure, and taking the place of other doors. Their door can take a variety of forms and leads to an endless and impossible maze of carpets, paintings and mirrors. They were permanently altered after [[Gertrude Robinson's]] interference in [[The Great Twisting]], wherein a human was given an accurate map of the corridors and guided to [[The Distortion]]'s core, with the human component combining with their being.
    - [[Michael Shelley|Michael]]: [[The Distortion]]'s first human form. As a human [[Michael Shelley]] was an archival assistant to [[Gertrude Robinson]], who she sacrificed to [[The Distortion]] to disrupt The Spiral's ritual.
    - [[Helen Richardson|Helen]]: [[The Distortion]]'s second human form. As a human [[Helen Richardson]] was a real estate agent ensnared by [[Michael Shelley|Michael]]. She drew her own map of the corridors and later replaces [[Michael Shelley|Michael]] as the human component of [[The Distortion]] after he is overwhelmed by emotions.
- [[The Man Who Wasn't There]]
- [[The Fractal Entity]]: In 1996, Ivo Lensik's father was being followed someone with "all the bones [in his] hands" not long after becoming obsessed with fractals. Although this description is similar to [[Michael Shelley|Michael]], as [[The Distortion]] became [[Michael Shelley|Michael]] sometime between 2009 and 2011 it is unclear who this entity may have been. Possibly [[The Distortion]] itself before [[Michael Shelley|Michael]] became it, and it became [[Michael Shelley|Michael]].
- [[Gabriel]]: An [[Avatar]] of the Spiral, also known as [[The Worker of Clay]]. He was the mastermind behind [[The Great Twisting]] in the late 2000s and committed suicide when it failed.
- [[The Lichtenberg Figure]]: A creature taking the form of a man with flashing Lichtenberg fractal organs. It tormented [[Michael Crew]] until he exploited the connection between Lichtenberg figures, lightning, and [[The Vast]] to trap it in the book [[Ex Altiora]].
- [[Doctor David]]: A possible avatar of [[Wonderland House]] who torments victims of The Spiral post-[[The Change|Change]]. He manipulates the victims into believing their legitimate mental health problems are made up for attention and berates them for it.

# Artefacts

- [[The Fractal Pot]]: A Chinese, Jiajing-era ceramic pot decorated in crisp geometric blue lines that repeat perfectly even as they grow smaller and denser. It takes things from its owner, along with all memories and evidence of those things, save the memories of its owner. It may be the residence of a being of the Spiral rather than an artefact itself, as one of its victims witness long, thin fingers with dirty nails emerge from the interior.
- [[The Pattern Rug]]: A rug with a pattern separate from this being. The pattern can remove itself from the rug and flow across other things in a mess of diamonds, swirls, and colours, a process that is painful to living creatures and can pull them apart from the inside. It is unclear whether the rug is powered by the Spiral or the pattern is a Spiral creature that merely resides upon the rug while not hunting.

# Locations

- [[Sannikov Land]] (Zemlya Sannikova): An island north of Russia that doesn't exist, defined by impossibility and structures that should not be able to exist. It was the staging ground of The Spiral's ritual sometime between 2009 and 2011.
- [[Wonderland House]]: The Spiral’s [[domain]] after [[The Change]]. It is a mental institute where a being known as [[Doctor David]] manipulates victims into believing that their mental health problems are made up for attention and berates them for it.
- [[The Distortion]]: A manifestation of [[The Distortion]] in the post-[[The Change|change]] world that took the shape of a constantly shifting, impossible to navigate hotel. The hotel was destroyed by [[Jonathan Sims]] in [[MAG 187: Checking Out]].
- [[An Unnamed Maze]] [[Domain]]: Similar to the one mentioned in [[MAG 100: I Guess You Had To Be There]]. [[Laverne]], [[Melanie King|Melanie's]] therapist, was trapped in it before she was rescued.

# Ritual

The Spiral's ritual is called "[[The Great Twisting]]", which took place in [[Sannikov Land]] (Zemlya Sannikova) sometime between 2009 and 2011. [[Gertrude Robinson]] stopped the ritual by sacrificing her assistant [[Michael Shelley]] to merge with [[The Distortion]], who then became [[Michael Shelley|Michael]]. The ritual failed as the unknowable being of [[The Distortion]] combined with a knowable being in the form of [[Michael Shelley]].

[[Gertrude Robinson]] used the statement from [[MAG 126: Sculptor's Tool]] in her research to formulate the counter-ritual, presumably taking inspiration from [[Gabriel]] saying that [[The Distortion]] does not have a name and would be confused by having one.

# Connections with other Entities

- Its allegiances are difficult to fully know, though it has been seen actively fighting against [[The Corruption]] and [[The Stranger]].
    - It seems to want balance or a delay in events as Michael explained in the tunnels when combating [[Not-Sasha]].
    - It helped the real Sasha fight a manifestation of [[The Flesh Hive]] (affiliated with [[The Corruption]]).

- The Spiral's relationship with [[The Eye]] is unknown, but [[The Distortion]]'s relationship with Beholding seems to be based on its human element's opinions.
    - [[Michael Shelley|Michael]] helped the Archives to foil others' plans, later stating he wanted neither the [[Circus]] nor the Archives to "win", making it convenient for him to kill [[Jonathan Sims|John]] himself before [[The Stranger]] could.
    - [[Helen Richardson|Helen]], on the other hand, is revealed in Season 4 to be regularly helping the Archives.
    - In [[MAG 187: Checking Out]] [[Jonathan Sims|John]] questions if [[Helen Richardson|Helen]] is working with [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] to stop him from reversing [[The Change]], something she firmly denies.

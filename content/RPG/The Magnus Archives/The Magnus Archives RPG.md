# Make Your Statement
# Face Your Fear

Based on the [podcast series](https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-archives/) by the [Rusty Quill](https://rustyquill.com/), [The Magnus Archives RPG](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game/) is produced by [Monte Cook Games](https://www.montecookgames.com/) using their [[Cypher System]].

In my humble opinion, the Magnus Archives RPG solves a lot of the problems that I have with the more popular, "contemporary cosmic horror game," [Call of Cthulhu](https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/):
- The player characters are a lot more competent than their BRP alternatives.
- The group have a *reason* to be encountering this weirdness out of the box.
- [[The Entities]] can still map to eldritch horrors from other games, should you feel the need to, "borrow," them.
- [[Cypher System]] [[Player Intrusions]] and [[Character Arcs]] allow players to influence the course of the scenario/campaign, which I think is essential in a modern game.

### Deep within the archives of the Magnus Institute dark things are stirring…

_An odd figure beckons drunken pubgoers into an alleyway—never to be seen again._ _A meat grinder somehow compels its users to merrily feed it their own limbs._ _A late-night subway train burrows itself into the earth, all but crushing its lone occupant._

For 200 years, [[The Magnus Institute]] has quietly collected statements like these from people of all walks of life, detailing their personal experiences with the supernatural. Your organization is dedicated to cataloguing and researching these incidents—but it’s becoming clear they aren’t as isolated as they first appear. There are connections between them—connections that suggest existential dangers to the world as we know it.

How will your team combat them, when simply coming to understand these dark forces threatens to bring you under their influence? Because when you stare into the archives, something starts to stare back.

Work alongside [[Jonathan Sims|Jonathan]] and [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]], [[Basira Hussain|Basira]], [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]], and the rest of the staff of [[The Magnus Institute]], or create your own branch of investigators. Encounter the [[NotThem]], the [[Anglerfish]], or [[The Man Upon the Stair]]. Learn the truth of the books of [[Jurgen Leitner]], the [[The Coffin|coffin]] that is also a pit, and [[The People’s Church of the Divine Host]].
### _The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game_ includes:

- Complete rules tailored for a story-based tabletop roleplaying experience in the eerie world of the popular The Magnus Archives horror podcast.
- An innovative process for creating witness statements to launch each adventure, investing the entire gaming group and creating an entirely new experience each session.
- Unique mechanics for handling fear and Stress, and for the remarkable changes that dealing with dark forces can inflict on a character over time.
- Dozens of creatures and NPCs to encounter, including beloved and feared NPCs from The Magnus Archives podcast such as [[Jonathan Sims]], [[Elias Bouchard]], and [[Jurgen Leitner]].

# Personality

Martin initially comes off as nervous and unassuming, and frequently takes on a nurturing role among the archival staff. He is an avid tea-drinker and regularly offers cups to his co-workers, especially [[Jonathan Sims|John]], of whom he is very fond. Although Martin cares very deeply for the people around him, he is a notably lonely person. Despite his efforts to make friends, he is not regarded well by his co-workers due to his poor work performance and is not known to have positive ties to anyone outside of the Archives.

Martin is very practical, often making preparations that those around him do not think to. Martin is often underestimated, something he takes great offence to, but which he also uses to his advantage at times. He is very sensitive and enjoys writing poetry, but is also easily hurt. He has a very animated manner of speech.

Martin is not known to use a specific label for his sexual orientation, but is attracted to men.

# Description

In [[MAG 22: Colony]], Martin describes himself as "not exactly the smallest guy in the world" when talking about climbing through a small basement window, and he is implied to be less skinny than [[Melanie king|Melanie]].

While taunting [[Jonathan Sims|John]] in [[MAG 165: Revolutions]], [[Not-Sasha]] describes Martin as looking "very comfortable" and "positively roomy".

Martin is stated to look almost exactly like his father, whose appearance is unknown.

When compared to [[Timothy Stoker]], [[Basira Hussain]] calls [[Timothy Stoke|Tim]] "the hot one."

# History

## Early History

Martin was born around 1987. His mother is chronically ill and lives in a care home in Devon. His father abandoned the family when Martin was about eight or nine years old, and at seventeen he dropped out of school to care for his mother.

He struggled to find a job and started to lie on his CV. Martin eventually landed a job at [[The Magnus Institute]] after claiming to have a master’s in parapsychology. He worked in the library and was transferred to the Archives by [[Elias Bouchard]] when [[Jonathan Sims]] was promoted to head archivist.

He first meets [[Jonathan Sims|John]] after accidentally letting a dog into the Archives.

## Season One

Martin is frequently mentioned alongside the other archival assistants during statement follow-ups. He is remarked as being notably worse at his job than [[Timothy Stoker|Tim Stoker]] or [[Sasha James]]. 

He is trapped in his apartment in Stockwell by [[Jane Prentiss]] from the end of February to March 12th, when he returns to the Archives and gives a statement. On [[Jonathan Sims|John's]] suggestion, he moves into the Archives.

He worries about [[Jane Prentiss]], particularly as her worms start to show up in the Archives. As a precaution, he takes to carrying a corkscrew to better extract the worms from flesh, and he hides CO2 fire extinguishers in old case file boxes.

On July 29, 2016, [[Jane Prentiss|Prentiss]] attacks the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]]. Martin is trapped with [[Jonathan Sims|John]] until [[Timothy Stoker|Tim]] breaks down a wall and leads them into the tunnels. As they flee from the worms, he becomes separated from the others and he eventually stumbles upon the body of [[Gertrude Robinson]].

## Season Two

About a month after [[Jane Prentiss|Prentiss’s]] attack, Martin has moved out of the Archives, leaving a few notebooks of poetry and an unfinished letter behind.

He contacts the ECDC and gets a jar of [[Jane Prentiss|Prentiss’]] ashes for [[Jonathan Sims|John]], who notes that Martin has been showing increased competence and apparent concern for his well-being since [[Jane Prentiss|Prentiss']] attack.

Martin walks in on John doing one of his supplemental recordings and sees that he has photos of [[Timothy Stoker|Tim’s]] house. He and [[Timothy Stoker|Tim]] eventually go to [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] to complain about [[Jonathan Sims|John]] stalking them.

After John is stabbed by [[The Distortion|Michael]], he lies to Martin, saying he accidentally stabbed himself with a bread knife. Martin becomes increasingly concerned over [[Jonathan Sims|John's]] well-being and begins watching him more closely.

Martin previously told [[Jonathan Sims|John]] that [[Trevor Herbert]] had passed away in the middle of his statement. After [[Jonathan Sims|John]] finds the second part of the statement, he confronts Martin and accuses him of lying. Martin apologises, admitting that he was simply repeating hearsay. [[Jonathan Sims|John]] continues to pressure him and Martin ultimately confesses to having lied on his CV when applying to [[The Magnus Institute]].

Martin helps [[TOmithy Stoker|Tim]], [[Not-Sasha]], and [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] stage an intervention for [[Jonathan Sims|John]].

On February 16, 2017, [[Jonathan Sims|John]] tells [[Timothy Stoker|Tim]] and Martin to head home early as he is feeling ill and does not want to infect them. They head out but sneak back later. [[Timothy Stoker|Tim]] is worried that [[Jonathan Sims|John]] is going to do something truly foolish and needs to be stopped while Martin is more concerned about [[Jonathan Sims|John's]] well-being. As they are skulking about [[Jonathan Sims|John's]] office, they see [[Not-Sasha]], in her monstrous form, head into the tunnels.

Martin refuses to leave [[Jonathan Sims|John]] and follows [[Not-Sasha]] into the tunnels. [[Timothy Stoker|Tim]] reluctantly tags along. As they look for [[Jonathan Sims|John]], [[the Distortion|Michael]] startles them. He finds [[Jonathan Sims|John's]] predicament amusing and does not want them to interfere. Martin seems ready to fight until he notices [[The Distortion|Michael’s]] hands, realising they are facing something supernatural, Martin and [[Timothy Stoker|Tim]] run away, straight into [[The Distortion|Michael’s]] door.

From their perspective, they appear to wander the corridors for days but when they find themselves back in the Archives, it is still the same evening. Unsure of what to do, they look for [[Jonathan Sims|John]] in his office and find the still-bleeding corpse of [[Jurgen Leitner]].

## Season Three

Following [[Jonathan Sims|John's]] departure from the Archives, Martin fills in for him and starts recording statements. The process seems to take a lot out of him. He is present when [[Jonathan Sims|John]] finally returns to confront [[Elias bouchard|Elias]] and is distraught to learn that [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] is a murderer and that [[Sasha James]] has been dead for nearly a year.

Martin helps research [[The Unknowing]] and together with the other assistants, he starts planning how to get rid of [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] without killing him. When the others leave to stop [[The Unknowing]], he and [[Melanie King]] stay behind.

He burns statements to distract [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] while [[Melanie King|Melanie]] breaks into his office. [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] punishes Martin by directly inserting the knowledge of how much his mother hates him into his mind but the plan is ultimately successful and [[Melanie King|Melanie]] manages to steal the recording of [[Jurgen Leitner|Leitner's]] murder.

They hand the recording to the police and [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] is put in jail but not before appointing [[Peter Lukas]] as the new head of the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]].

## Season Four

After [[The Unknowing]] has been stopped, [[Timothy Stoker|Tim]] is dead, [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]] is missing, and [[Jonathan Sims|John]] is in a medically impossible coma. It seems unlikely that he will ever wake up and Martin grieves for him. He is left working with [[Basira Hussain|Basira]] and [[Melanie King|Melanie]] under [[Peter Lukas]].

About two months after [[The Unknowing]], Martin’s mother passes away and he feels as though he has nothing left to live for. In late 2017, he teams up with [[Peter Lukas|Peter]], agreeing to work for him in if he keeps the others safe. He tells himself that it is to protect the others but he thinks it might also just be a good way to get himself killed.

[[Johnathan Sims|John]] returns in February, 2018 and Martin finds a new purpose. He intends to protect [[Johnathan Sims|John]] by keeping [[Peter Lukas|Peter's]] attention fixed on himself, even if it means cutting himself off from everyone else.

He gradually learns what [[Peter Lukas|Peter]] has planned for him. [[Peter Lukas|Peter]] believes that [[The Extinction]], a fifteenth [[The Entities|Entity]], is emerging and it could mean the end of the world. He is trying to learn more about it and believes the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]] has a device which will allow him to do just that. It requires someone aligned with [[The Eye]] to use and that is where Martin comes in. [[Peter Lukas|Peter]] intends to make him aligned to both [[The Eye]] and [[The Lonely]] so that he can use the device while ultimately serving [[Peter Lukas|Peter's]] interests.

On March 24, after [[Johnathan Sims|John]] descends into [[The Buried]]'s [[The Coffin|coffin]], Martin places numerous tape recorders around it. He is unsure where he got the idea from but feels it might help him find the way out.

On June 12, Martin takes the statement of a distressed woman and learns that [[Jonathan Sims|John]] has traumatised her by compelling her to give a statement against her will. He eventually leaves the recording for [[Basira Hussain|Basira]] and the others to find, asking them to talk to [[Jonathan Sims|John]] about it.

[[Peter Lukas|Peter]] has had him record statements relating to [[The Extinction]] and despite his distaste for [[Peter Lukas|Peter]], Martin is forced to admit that the threat seems real. He also starts to find his isolation comfortable and manifests the ability to vanish through [[The Lonely]].

[[Peter Lukas|Peter's]] preparations are finally complete and he brings Martin to the device: [[The Panopticon]] of [[Millbank Prison]]. It is currently inhabited by the body of [[Jonah Magnus]] and Martin will have to kill him to take his place. [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] shows up and reveals that he has been [[Jonah Magnus]] all along and has been prolonging his life by transferring his eyes to new bodies over time. Martin desperately wants to kill him but refuses to go through with it.

He does believe that [[The Extinction]] is real but also that everything [[Peter Lukas|Peter]] has been doing is just a power play against [[Jonah Magnus|Jonah]], and he is not playing along any more. [[Peter Lukas|Peter]] is upset at having been so thoroughly fooled and, at [[Jonah Magnus|Jonah's]] behest, he casts Martin into [[The Lonely]].

For all his pretence, Martin’s connection to [[The Lonely]] is real and he is deep in its grip. [[Jonathan Sims|John]] tracks him down and tries to bring him out of [[The Lonely]] but Martin simply confesses that he loved him and vanishes. [[Jonathan Sims|John]] finds him again after killing [[Peter Lukas|Peter]]. He urges Martin to look at him and finally manages to pull him from [[The Lonely]]'s grasp. They leave together.

Martin and [[Jonathan Sims|John]] flee the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]] and go into hiding. They settle into comfortable domesticity in one of [[Alice "Daisy" Tonning|Daisy’s]] safe houses in Scotland. They keep in touch with [[Basira Hussain|Basira]] and after three weeks, she sends some statements as sustenance for [[Jonathan Sims|John]]. Martin goes for a walk to give him some privacy as he reads one. While he is away, [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] tricks [[Jonathan Sims|John]] into completing a mass [[Rituals|ritual]], summoning all [[The Entities]] into the world and bringing about the apocalypse.

## Season Five

After [[The Change]], he and [[Jonthan Sims|John]] shelter in the cabin for an indeterminate amount of time. They eventually leave and head toward the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]], looking for a way to undo [[The Change]].

In [[MAG 200: Last Words]], [[Jonathan Sims|John]] kills [[Jonah Magnus]] and becomes the pupil of [[The Eye]]. Martin follows him and after a last-ditch debate, stabs [[Jonathan Sims|John]] to release the powers into new worlds. Once the world has returned to normal, neither [[Jonathan Sims|John]] nor Martin are found in the rubble of the panopticon and it is unclear what has become of them.

# Description

Mary Keay is described as a very old woman. Prior to her first death, she had a full head of hair and no tattoos, but, after her death, she is described as having a clean-shaven head and skin completely covered in "closely written words" in Sanskrit.

She was also described in her youth as "...beautiful, but like a shark was beautiful," by [[Eric Delano]].

# History

Mary is descended from [[Albrecht von Closen]] through his descendant [[Elsa von Closen]], who moved to England and in 1920 married [[Michael Keay]]. The couple had a daughter, [[Mary Keay]], in 1924. (Whether this is _the_ Mary Keay is unclear as, in MAG 62, Mary states she was 9 years old in 1955.)

Sometime before 1955, her father committed suicide by slitting his throat with a straight razor, which was left to Mary. Mary claims this was the only good thing he ever did for his family. Mary's mother worked part-time for [[The Magnus Institute]], which did not pay well enough to support the family; she also worked at a factory on Globe street to make ends meet. In her spare time, she instructed Mary on her "true studies," and young Mary spent much of her time scouring secondhand and antique shops for paranormal [[Artefacts]].

In 1955, Mary started watching [[Dr. Margaret Tellison]], a doctor who lived near her and had her practice in her house, noticing that she seemed to have an aura of power around her. [[Dr. Margaret Tellison]] was a novelty in Mary's neighbourhood because she grew up in a Jewish neighbourhood, and [[Dr. Margaret Tellison|Tellison]] was a gentile woman. Eventually, she saw the doctor murder an unnamed patient and write on their skin; later, she saw her reading from [[Catalogue of the Trapped Dead|a book made of human skin]] and summon a spirit trapped within to ask them for their financial information. Mary was offended seeing that the doctor was only using her power to make money. Soon after, she committed her first murder, slitting the doctor's throat. She admits to [[Gertrude Robinson|Gertrude]] that she enjoyed watching the doctor commit the murder more than she enjoyed performing a kill herself. Mary stole the two paranormal books the doctor kept in her safe, the one made of human skin and used to trap spirits, and one full of poems about dying animals written in Sanskrit.

She spent the next several years mastering the [[Catalogue of the Trapped Dead]] and learned Sanskrit.

Her son, [[Gerard Keay]], was born at some point in the 1980s, as he was in his late teens in or not long before 2002. His father was [[Eric Delano]], who worked in the Archives of [[The Magnus Institute]]. They met sometime between the late 1960s or 1970s near the beginning of her ownership of [[Pinhole Books]] and were married an unmentioned number of years later. He was murdered by Mary not long after their son's birth. She murdered him by stabbing him with a pair of gardening shears and supposedly showed little remorse. She was said to be "slow and steady and focused", not making any comments as she killed him, according to [[Eric Delano|Eric's]] entry in the book he was bound in. She was stated to often summon him out of the book after his death and used him to bounce ideas and plots off of.

## Career

At some point, Mary opened '[[Pinhole Books]],' a shop in Morden, London that specialized in rare and antique books. [[Gerard Keay|Gerard]] referred to this as her "day job"; she also had another "vocation" that involved the supernatural and meeting with supernatural creatures. Both jobs required frequent travel.

[[Jurgen Leitner]] first visited [[Pinhole Books]] in 1993. He is known to have purchased several books from Mary, including the dead animal poem book.

## Death

Sometime in 2008, she was found dead of a supposed overdose; although she had been partially flayed. Pieces of her skin were hanging nearby, covered in Sanskrit. [[Gerard Keay|Gerard]] was tried for her murder, but he was acquitted when an important piece of evidence was ruled inadmissible.

As explained by [[Gerard Keay|Gerard]] in [[MAG 111: Family Business]], Mary's death was self-inflicted, as she died while attempting to complete a ritual to take control of the [[Catalogue of the Trapped Dead]]. After [[Gerard Keay|Gerard's]] arrest, Mary manifested and somehow removed the book from the evidence lockup, while contaminating all the rest of the evidence against [[Gerard Keay|Gerard]]. Through this ritual, she was able to project herself into the world, and "continue her work."

[[Pinhole Books]] closed officially after her death.

## Undeath

In 2012, [[Dominic Swain]] came into possession of the book _[[Ex Altiora]]_. Eventually, he found [[Pinhole Books]] which was staffed by an old woman with a shaved head and sporting numerous tattoos of words all over her body.

In 2013, [[Gerard Keay|Gerard]] gives the [[Catalogue of the Trapped Dead]] to [[Gertrude Robinson]] and she forces Mary to teach her how to use the book before killing her by destroying her page.

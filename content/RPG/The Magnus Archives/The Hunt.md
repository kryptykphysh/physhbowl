 *Entity inspired Tarot by Grace Holsten*
 
 > _"Been a long time since humans had any proper sense of our place on the food chain. I mean, we haven't been prey for, what, thousands of years?"  
> "But I mean, hunting, killing each other? That's just how wild animals work. It's natural."  
> "So's death. But we're still [[The End|afraid of it]]."  
> - [[Gerard Keay]] and [[Jonathan Sims]], [[MAG 111]]

The Hunt is one of [[The Entities]]. It is one of the most primal powers, the animalistic and instinctual fear of being hunted or chased, of becoming prey. It doesn't affect humans too much due to their self-removal from the natural food chain but still manifests through with an affinity or love for tracking, finding and hunting.

# Characters

- Hunters: Avatars adept at finding and killing monsters and Avatars with a predatory, feral savagery. Hunters often feel a sense of satisfaction when hunting, with some viewing this feeling as a kind of addiction. The need to Hunt is also sometimes described as being able to feel or sense "blood," guiding them towards victims, giving Hunters a predatory bloodlust. Hunters seem to have the ability to injure and kill Avatars of other entities using conventional methods, able to tear apart other avatars with their bare hands or using conventional weapons like knives and guns. As a result, Hunters are often hired or coerced into serving other Entities.
- [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner]]
- [[Trevor Herbert]]
- [[Julia Montauk]]
- [[Basira Hussain]]: Though she never became a full hunter she was extremely close and was still heavily tied to the Hunt.
- [[Vampires]]: Creatures hunted by Trevor Herbert and killed by the explorers in The Everchase, with an unknown connection to The Hunt.
- [['Werewolf']]: Monster that stalked and killed hikers in a forest. Considering the fact that some Hunters have shown animalistic qualities when they fully commit to a hunt, and it is possible that this creature may have once been a Hunter.
- [[The Admiral]]: [[Georgie Barker's]] cat who, after [[The Change]], ended up in a Hunt domain as a more monstrous form of himself.
- "Crusading Hunter of the Reformation": Killed a servant of [[The Web]] and resident of [[Hill Top Road]], possibly an avatar of The Hunt.
# Artefacts

There are no known artefacts associated with the Hunt.
# Locations

- [[The Forest Domain]]: A domain in the post-[[Change]] world where a pack works as a collective to hunt a common prey, turning on each other whenever they need a new target.
- [[Cat Domain]]: A domain where monstrously transformed cats chase "prey." The Admiral resides in it post-Change.
# Ritual

The Hunt's ritual is potentially called the Everchase. Little is currently known about it; [[Gertrude Robinson]] was considering the US as a potential location for it, though "not completely sold", and thought it would likely take place sometime after that of The Buried.
# Connections to other Entities

- [[Adelard Dekker]] mentions that if an avatar of [[The End]] becomes strong enough, only a Hunter could defeat it (and he finds them too unpredictable to make that his first choice).
- [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy Tonner]] spends a significant amount of time killing mannequins belonging to [[The Stranger]] while she is forced to work for [[The Eye]] via [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]].
- When necessary, an avatar of [[The Slaughter]] can defend a place or group of people from other Entities. However, while Hunters thrive on the role, avatars of The Slaughter seem to devolve into constant rage and unhappiness (at least in the case of [[Melanie King]]).
# Trivia

- [[Jonathan Sims|Jonny Sims]] cites [Bloodborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne) as "a little bit of an influence" on the development of the Hunt as a concept.
- Police officers seem especially prone to the Hunt, notably [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy Tonner]] and [[MAG 92: Nothing Beside Remains|other Section 31 officers]].
- According to [[MAG 200: Last Words|MAG 200]], the Hunt was part of the "original" Fear, from which the other Entities split off from as humanity evolved.

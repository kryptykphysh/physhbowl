# Personality

John initially comes across as rude and short-tempered. He is dismissive and condescending toward written statement givers as well as one of his assistants, [[Martin Blackwood]]. When faced with statement givers in person, John is initially rude and rejects their experiences as tricks of the mind. However, over time, he softens and offers genuine compassion to those that have been traumatised or scared by what they have experienced. He eventually admits that he, too, is afraid of the monsters and supernatural subjects of statements, but covers it up with a scornful exterior.

John shies away from violence and does not have much courage. He often panics when intimidated or threatened, causing him to stutter. He claims that he is not a brave man, but he is, in certain circumstances, a very stubborn man. Despite this, John is very persistent and will push past his fear when doing what he thinks is right. He feels intense guilt for his actions as The Archivist and mourns both the mistakes he has made and the loss of his humanity.

# Description

John has prematurely greying hair and looks older than he is. He often looks very tired and is physically unfit, as other characters refer to him as scrawny and he tires easily from physical tasks that others perform with little exertion.

Over time, John has acquired several scars from various encounters. He has extensive and visible scarring from worms burying into him during [[Jane Prentiss]] attack on [[The Magnus Institute]]. One of his hands was severely burnt after accepting a handshake from [[Jude Perry]] and he required five stitches after being stabbed by [[The Distortion|Michael]]. He likely has a scar on his neck from [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]] after she tries to kill him. [[Melanie King|Melanie]] stabs John after he performs surgery on her, leaving another scar on one of his shoulders.

# History

## Early History

John was born circa 1987 and comes from Bournemouth. His father passed away when he was two years old and his mother died a few years later, leaving him to be raised by his paternal grandmother.

John was a smart but difficult child. He got bored easily and would wander off. His grandmother found books were helpful for keeping him in one place, but he hated to read anything he felt like he'd already read before, meaning most authors could only provide him with one book.

His first experience with the supernatural occurred when he was 8 years old, around 1995/96 – an early encounter with a [[The Web|Web]]-related [[Jurgen Leitner|Leitner]] [[A Guest For Mr. Spider|book]] that claimed the life of an 18-year-old that bullied him. He has had a fear of spiders ever since.

A long time before 2017, he was in a relationship with [[Georgie Barker]], though they did not part on the best terms. Both he and [[Georgie Barker|Georgie]] attended Oxford.

He took a job with [[The Magnus Institute]]'s research department in 2011 and was made Head Archivist in 2015. When promoted, John requests [[Sasha James]] and [[Timothy Stoker|Tim Stoker]] as assistants. Without telling John, [[Elias Bouchard]] also transfers [[Martin Blackwood]] to the Archives. He meets [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] on his first day in the Archives, just after [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] has accidentally let a dog into the Archives.

John used to smoke but quit in 2012. That same year, his grandmother passed away.

### Season One

John starts out cranky at [[Gertrude Robinson|Gertrude]] and dismissive of many of the cases, believing that reports of the truly arcane or esoteric are few and far between, though events of late are starting to seem worrisome. He has done almost all of the audio recordings for the Magnus Archives. He is helped by archival researchers [[Martin Blackwood]], [[Sasha James]], and [[Timothy Stoker|Tim Stoker]], though he seems to hold [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] in particularly low regard, at least until after the latter’s encounter with [[Jane Prentiss]]. Jonathan Sims is keen to digitise the Archives; however, attempts to record certain cases onto his laptop have caused significant audio distortions, so he has had to settle for recording onto an archaic tape recorder.

Following [[Martin Blackwood|Martin's]] encounter with [[Jane Prentiss]] and her subsequent siege of the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]], he has become more and more concerned about the dangers of his job, including a sense that he and his co-workers are being hunted.

John survives the [[Jane Prentiss|Prentiss]] attack with scars from the worms and significant mental trauma. He is convinced that [[Gertrude Robinson]]'s death was not natural and there is some deeper mystery about the statements. He believes that she was murdered by someone at the Archives for what she knew, and is determined to find the truth.

### Season Two

After the attack on the Archives, John is forced to take a month off to recover. His paranoia builds after the reveal of his murdered predecessor, and John becomes suspicious of all the Archives' employees. He starts keeping two tape recorders - a normal one, and second supplemental to record his suspicions as he begins spying on the staff. [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] notices John's agitated behaviour and gives him a jar of [[Jane Prentiss]]' ashes in an attempt to assuage him.

During some of his time off, he sneaks into work at night to explore the tunnels under the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]]. He chronicles his explorations, finding evidence of [[Jurgen Leitner|someone]] living in the tunnels, but eventually pauses exploring after a harrowing encounter in one of the lower levels.

John seems genuinely baffled at [[Martin Blackwood|Martin's]] worry for him. He even goes so far as classifying his behaviour as suspicious, wondering if Martin is trying to hide something from him by making John take time off.

John stalks his assistants at their homes and spends a significant amount of time after work exploring the tunnels. He gets [[Basira Hussain]] to bring him tapes recorded by [[Gertrude Robinson|Gertrude]] from her murder investigation to understand what [[Gertrude Robinson|Gertrude]]was involved in.

John meets with [[Melanie King]] a few times. After learning from her that there is something wrong with [[Sasha James]], he realises that Sasha has been replaced by [[Not-Sasha]]. John takes an axe to [[The Web Table]] held in artefact storage, knowing it is tied to what has taken [[Sasha James|Sasha]] and hoping to destroy it but finds that the table was actually binding and limiting its power. John flees from the freed [[NotThem]] before he is rescued by [[Jurgen Leitner]], who was living in the tunnels. [[Jurgen Leitner|Leitner]] tells him about the existence of [[The Entities]]; John that the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]] is a place of power for the entity known as '[[The Eye|Beholding]]' and that he belongs to it too. John is overwhelmed and leaves for a cigarette, but [[Jurgen Leitner|Leitner]] is murdered by [[Elias Bouchard]] before he returns.

### Season Three

Wanted for [[Jurgen Leitner|Leitner's]] murder, John hides out at [[Georgie Barker]]'s house and gets [[Melanie King]] to find info for him from the Archives while he's unable to return.

He goes to [[Jude Perry]] and [[Michael Crew]] for statements. As [[Michael Crew]] finishes his, police officer [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner]] knocks on the door and tries to kill John. [[Basira Hussain]] saves him, and they go interrogate [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] about [[Gertrude Robinson|Gertrude's]] murder.

John and [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]] later capture and interrogate [[Sarah Baldwin]] about [[The Unknowing]], which gets the attention of [[Nikola Orsinov]], who first tries to get him to find the ancient [[Gorilla Skin]] [[Gertrude Robinson|Gertrude]] stole, but later kidnaps him, intending to use his skin for the ritual herself. [[Micahel Crew|Michael]] shows up to kill him before she can, but is replaced by [[Helen Richardson|Helen]], who is now [[The Distortion]] and decides to rescue John instead.

John travels to China and America. In the latter, he meets [[Trevor Herbert]] and [[Julia Montauk]]. He talks to [[Gerard Keay]] in the [[Catalogue of the Trapped Dead]] and learns about [[The Entities]] in greater detail. After being away from [[The Magnus Institute|the institute]] for weeks, he finds out he has a "physical dependence" to statements, ending up sick if he goes too long without them.

John stops [[The Unknowing]] with the help of his assistants but ends up in a coma.

### Season Four

While in a six-month coma, John is visited by [[Oliver Banks]], who reveals that death is the final step required to become an [[Avatar]] of an [[The Entities|entity]]. John flatlines, then wakes up from his coma. He subsequently starts referring to himself as "[[The Archivist]]," marking his acceptance of being an [[Avatar]] of [[The Eye|the Beholding]].

After he gets out of the hospital, he resumes his position in the Archives and comes back to find [[Melanie King|Melanie]] and [[Basira Hussain|Basira]] have moved into the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]] as it's too unsafe outside, [[Timothy Stoker|Tim]] is dead, [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]] is missing, and [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] is absent. He's worried about [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] working with [[Peter Lukas]], but stays away after [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] asks John to leave him alone.

John finds out [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]] is still alive - trapped in [[The Coffin]]. [[Breekon & Hope|Breekon]] breaks into the Archives meaning to attack John but ends up fleeing after John forcibly extracts a statement from his mind, leaving [[The Coffin]]. John discovers he could go into [[The Coffin]] and have a chance of coming back if he has a physical anchor - a body part - left behind to come back to. After attempting to chop off a finger for an anchor and healing supernaturally, [[Melanie King|Melanie]] takes John to [[Jared Hopworth]] the Boneturner, who is trapped in [[Helen Richardson|Helen's]] door after his attack on the Archives. In return for his freedom, [[Jared hopworth|Jared]] agrees to take one of John's ribs out. John offers another rib to [[Jared Hopworth|Jared]] for his statement. He goes into [[The Coffin]] and finds [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]], but is stuck inside with her. They only escape when John is guided back by the dozens of tape recorders replaying statements on top of the coffin. The tape recorders are later revealed to be left there by a worried [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]].

John and [[Basira Hussain|Basira]] travel to [[Ny-Ålesund]] to stop what they assume is [[The Dark|the Dark's]] [[Rituals|ritual]], [[The Extinguished Sun]]. They meet [[Manuela Dominguez]], who is guarding what is left of [[The Dark Sun]]. John looks at [[The Dark Sun]] despite [[Manuela Dominguez|Manuela's]] warnings, and he collapses after looking at it. The star is extinguished.

[[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] gets a statement from a woman claiming to have been harassed by John. After finding out John forced the statement from her and subsequently appeared in her dreams, [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] delivers the tape to [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]], [[Melanie King|Melanie]], and [[Basira Hussain|Basira]]. The three hound John, and he admits to forcing and 'feeding' on the statement of five people total, including the woman from [[Martin Blackwood|Martin's]] statement. [[Basira Hussain|Basira]] calls John a danger and a monster, and John admits he's not sure he can control it. He worries he might be being controlled by [[The Web]].

After going to the [[Hill Top Road|house on Hill Top Road]] and reading a statement from [[Annabelle Cane]], John confessed he's not being controlled. Taking live statements feels good and even though he could stop, he doesn't want to. He feels guilty feeling that way. Under the watch of the girls, he stops taking live statements and records more 'stale' ones. It doesn't feed his hunger, but it stops him from starving. Similar to post-[[The Coffin|coffin]] [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]], he goes through withdrawal and is constantly weak and hungry.

John looks through a box of Gertrude's old tapes and tries to focus on the ones he isn't drawn to. One particular tape he has trouble forcing himself to press play. The tape is the statement of [[Eric Delano]] and details his method to escape the hold the Eye has over him - to remove his eyes. John curses, but confronts [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] with the idea, asking him to gouge their eyes out and run away together. After being rejected, he presumably tells the girls the method, of who only [[Melanie King|Melanie]] ends up going through with it.

Finding a tape left on his desk, John discovers Martin has gone with Peter Lukas to the centre of the tunnels under the Institute. He tries to get help from several different people, but ends up going alone after [[The Magnus Institute|the Institute]] comes under siege by [[Julia Montauk]], [[Trevor Herbert]], and [[Not-Sasha]]. John is guided to [[The Panopticon]] in the centre of the tunnels by [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]], who tells him [[Peter Lukas|Peter]] has taken [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] into [[The Lonely]]. John goes in after them.

In [[The Lonely]], he finds [[Peter Lukas]], who tries to dissuade John from finding [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] and convince him that if he stayed in [[The Lonely]], he wouldn't be able to hurt anyone else. Not fooled, John compels a statement out of him. [[Peter Lukas|Peter]] refuses to tell John what [[Elias Bouchard|Elias']] plans are though. John compels him so hard that the act of defying [[The Archivist]] kills [[Peter Lukas|Peter]]. John finds [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] and together they leave [[The Lonely]].

After John and [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] leave [[The Lonely]], they go to one of [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy's]] safe houses in Scotland. John reads one of the statements [[Basira Hussain|Basira]] brought him while [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] goes for a walk. The statement starts with the usual - name of the statement giver and description of events - but it's revealed that [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] put that there as a front, and the real statement is [[Jonah Magnus]]' retelling of events. John is compelled to read the letter and is physically harmed if he tries to stop. [[Jonah Magnus|Jonah]] reveals that his [[Rituals|ritual]] required [[The Archivist]] to have an encounter with every [[The Entities|Fear entity]], and lists the ones John has had, [[The Lonely]] being the last one. Jonah explains that every other [[Rituals|ritual]] has failed because they attempted to bring just one [[The Entities|Fear]] into the world when all the [[The Entitites|Fears]] are connected. John is forced to read an incantation, and all [[The Entities|Entities]] are brought into the world at once.

### Season Five

After [[The Change]], John and [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] shelter in the cabin for an indeterminate amount of time. They eventually leave and head toward the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]], looking for a way to undo [[The Change]].

John eventually kills [[Jonah Magnus]] and becomes the pupil of [[The Eye]]. [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] arrives and after a last-ditch debate, stabs John to release the powers into new worlds. Once the world returns to normal, neither John nor [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] are found in the rubble of [[The Panopticon]] and it is unclear what has become of them.

# Known Powers

- **Persona** - When recording a written statement, [[The Archivist]] takes on the voice and persona of the statement giver, reading the story with audibly different tones of voice and occasionally changing pitches to match the statement giver's. [[The Archivist]] is notably absorbed in the statements, becoming irritated if interrupted. John has shown worry over [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] reading multiple statements, possibly insinuating it's the statements themselves that affect the reader.
- **Receive Statement** - While reading a statement, John knows any languages necessary in order to understand the statement; while he has never needed to do this with a statement given directly by the subject, he _has_ taken at least one statement while unable to physically hear the statement-giver, implying that this more power more broadly overcomes difficulties that would prevent John from taking a statement.
    - **Archivist's Presence** - Statement givers are able to eloquently and coherently tell their stories in a narratively interesting statement, regardless of their background or emotional state, provided the [[The Eye|Beholding]] is aware of [[The Archivist's]] location. This is highlighted when John is kidnapped by [[The Stranger]] in a place the [[The Eye|Beholding]] can't see. The statement givers tell short, curt statements, often going off-topic and needing encouragement to share details. This power makes statements more receivable by everyone, not just [[The Archivist]].
 **Compulsion** - [[The Archivist]] is able to compel others to answer a question or give a statement. It is implied that it can be taken a step further and compel someone to physically do something against their will. It is possible to resist the compulsion, but almost everyone who has successfully resisted has been affiliated with an [[The Entities|Entity]] or is an [[Avatar]] themselves. [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] describes the feeling of being compelled as 'quite nice' and 'tingly.'
- **Knowing** - [[The Archivist]] is able to Know certain things without having prior knowledge of them. This most often happens with relevant information to statements or the situation at hand. John has experienced pain while purposely trying to Know what an [[The Entities|Entity]] is planning.
    - **Understanding** - John has been shown to understand written and spoken languages he has never learned. It is unclear if he can respond in those languages, as he has only ever spoken English.
- **Inhuman Healing** - [[The Archivist]] recovers from physical wounds remarkably fast. The more powerful [[The Archivist]] becomes, the quicker the wound heals. When John tries to cut his finger off, the cut heals as soon as he withdraws the knife.
    - **Feed Your Patron** - When [[The Archivist]] records or takes a statement, wounds heal faster. John was able to recover enough from his coma to be able to leave the hospital after reading just one statement. It is a double-edged sword, however. After John stops forcing live statements from people, he gets weak and hungry, going through a sort of withdrawal. [[Jude Perry]] used the phrase "Feed [[your god]]... or it will feed on you." Similarly, when John is away from the Archives for weeks without reading a statement, he reports feeling sick, dizzy, and confused, and feels better after reading one.
- **Reliving Nightmares** - After statement givers tell their story to [[The Archivist]], they frequently relive their experience in a nightmare, sometimes taking on the roles of the creature they saw. [[The Archivist]] shares these dreams and is always present to the dreamer, observing events but never interfering. [[Elias Bouchard]] reveals in a statement that John has these dreams every night, cycling through those who have given their statements. [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]] employees and other [[Avatar|avatars]] are exempt from these dreams.
- **Knowledge Insertion** - John demonstrates a similar power to [[Elias Bouchard|Elias']] when he forces [[Not-Sasha]] to experience the suffering she inflicted on her victims.
- **Role Reversal** - In the post-[[The Change|Change]] world, John has the power to shift [[The Eye]]'s focus; turning a watcher into the watched, the feared to being afraid, and vice versa. Revoking someone's watcher status destroys those whose existence depends on being feared. Turning someone into a watcher releases them from being tormented and makes them feed on fear instead. This ability is reliant on [[The Eye]] being able to focus on the subject, something that makes beings with shifting forms (such as [[The Distortion]]) difficult for it to target. However, focusing in on a detail about the creature that it cannot change can seemingly bypass this.

- **Wrongly Assumed Power:**
    - [[Tape Recorders]] frequently show up and start recording on their own when important things are happening, or a statement is being given. This is not due to John's connection to [[The Eye]] but the work of [[Annabelle Cane]] and [[The Web]].

# Marks from Entities

John has been marked in one way or another by every [[The Entities|Entity]]. Almost every mark has been orchestrated by [[Elias Bouchard]]. Marks take the form of scars, injuries, or encounters. [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] has called John a "chronicle of fear" in reference to the gathering of these marks.

- [[The Web]] - John's childhood encounter with [[A Guest for Mr. Spider]]. He would have been eaten if not for his childhood bully taking the Leitner away and getting enthralled in John's place.
- [[The Corruption]] - [[Jane Prentiss]]' attack on the Archives, which left John with pockmark scars where the worms burrowed into his skin.
- [[The Spiral]] - [[Helen Richardson]]'s statement drew [[The Distortion]]'s attention to John. He has gone through the doors several times and been stabbed once by [[Michael Shelley|Michael]]. He has had multiple encounters with both [[Michael Shelley|Michael]] and [[Helen Richardson|Helen]]. [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] commented that John is deeply marked by [[The Spiral]].
- [[The Stranger]] - [[Not-Sasha]]'s infiltration of the [[The Magnus Insititute|Institute]] and John's close encounter with her, as well as [[The Unknowing]].
- [[The Desolation]] - [[Jude Perry]], an avatar of [[The Desolation]], gave John her statement and shook his hand, burning him.
- [[The Vast]] - [[Mike Crew]], an [[Avatar]] of [[The Vast]], gave John his statement and let him experience the sensation of [[The Vast]] firsthand.
- [[The Hunt]] - [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy's]] attempted murder of him, interrupted by [[Basira Hussain]]. Planned by [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] in that he "[[left]] the matter of Jonathan Sims up to [[her]]", and requested she kill him quickly.
- [[The Slaughter]] - [[Melanie King]], infected with a bullet that fuelled her with rage, stabbed John when he attempted surgery to remove it. [[Elias bouchard|Elias]] hired [[Melanie King|Melanie]] as a way of keeping her in the Archives until she could mark John.
- [[The End]] - John's attempt to stop [[The Unknowing]] left him in a coma where he was "all but brain dead," during which he was approached by [[Oliver Banks]], an [[Avatar]] of [[The End]], and then died before fully becoming the [[The Eye|Beholding's]] [[Avatar]].
- [[The Flesh]] - John had two ribs removed by [[Jared Hopworth]], an [[Avatar]] of [[The Flesh]].
- [[The Buried]] - John's descent into [[The Coffin]] to rescue [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]]. [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] purposely sent [[Basira Hussain|Basira]] away to give John a chance to go in.
- [[The Dark]] - In [[Ny-Ålesund]] John looked upon [[The Dark Sun]], a star left behind from [[The Dark]]'s failed [[Rituals|ritual]], and destroyed it. It was said that only powerful followers of [[The Dark]] could safely look at it.
- [[The Lonely]] - [[Peter Lukas]], an [[Avatar]] of [[The Lonely]], had taken Martin into a pocket dimension of [[The Lonely]]. John went in after them and killed [[Peter Lukas|Peter]] in the process.

# Non-Appearances

As the main character of the show, John appears in almost every episode - thus it is easier to simply list the episodes he _hasn't_ been heard in. Asterisks* mark episodes he still features prominently in as the subject; **bold** marks episodes where he is not even mentioned.

# Trivia

- In official transcripts, [[The Archivist]]'s name is shortened to John. This was an intentional choice by author Jonathan Sims in order to create psychological distance between himself and the character who shares his name. However, both John and Jon are considered acceptable spellings.
- John sings for just a few seconds in [[MAG 31: First Hunt]] at the 13:25-15:00 mark (differs depending on where you listen).
    - John's voice actor, Jonny Sims, was in the band [The Mechanisms](https://themechanisms.com/the-crew/) with fellow TMA voice actors Frank Voss ([[Basira Hussain]]), Jessica Law ([[Nikola Orsinov]]), and Tim Ledsam ([[Jordan Kennedy]]).
- John says "I love you" to [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] in [[MAG 161: Dwelling]]. Before that, [[The Admiral]] was the only character John had been recorded saying "I love you" to.
- John is implied to be asexual in [[MAG 106: A Matter Of Perspective]] and has shown romantic interest in both men and women. Writer Jonny Sims has confirmed that [[The Archivist]] was written as asexual in the [Season 4 Q+A Part 1](https://play.acast.com/s/themagnusarchives/mag160.1-season4q-apart1) and on Twitter, but he is not sure what [[The Archivist]] himself would identify as since he is not the kind of person to openly talk about feelings or sexuality.
- All characters refer to John as 'him' but the show notes for [[MAG 132: Entombed]] refer to John as 'they'. Jonny Sims has clarified on Twitter that the show notes are not written by him and this is not indicative of any deeper canon meaning, but as [[The Archivist]]'s gender will likely be unimportant to the plot, there is also nothing to contradict a non-binary interpretation of the character.
- In the season 2 Q&A, Jonny Sims speculates that [[The Archivist]] might enjoy reading non-fiction and watching documentaries in his spare time.
- In D&D John would be a warlock who thinks he is a druid.
- [[Gertrude Robinson]] and [[Jurgen Leitner]] are voiced by Jonny Sim's real-life parents, Sue Sims and Paul Sims.
- John hates The Archers, having been introduced to it by [[Alice "Daisy" Tonner|Daisy]].
- He likes rum and raisin ice cream.

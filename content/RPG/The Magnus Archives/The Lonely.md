*Entity inspired Tarot by Grace Holsten*

> _"The feeling that you're just… alone. Maybe there's no one else there at all, maybe you just can't connect."  
> - [[Gerard Keay]], [[MAG 111]]_

The Lonely is one of [[The Entities]]. It is a manifestation of the fear of isolation, of being completely cut off and alone, the fear of being disconnected. Victims are generally either predisposed to isolation or simply have the misfortune to cross paths with the [[Lukas Family]]. The Lonely often manifests as fog, ships, travel and faceless crowds.

Many entities prey on isolated victims or isolate victims while they are tormented in other ways, including [[The Buried]], [[The Stranger]], [[The Web]], and [[The Spiral]]. Episodes where a victim is alone or ends up on their own are not inherently connected to The Lonely, and are not listed as such unless the episode specifically centres around an intense fear or love of isolation or distance.

# Characters

- [[Martin Blackwood]]: Groomed by [[Peter Lukas]] to serve the Lonely, as he required someone with the ability to bridge the gap between the Lonely and [[The Eye]] in order to utilise the power of [[Jonah Magnus]]' [[The Panopticon|panopticon]].
- The [[Lukas Family]] worships the Lonely.
    - [[Peter Lukas]]: Captain of _The Tundra_ and a particularly noteworthy [[avatar]] of the Lonely.
    - [[Mordechai Lukas]]: A member of the [[Lukas Family]], who knew [[Jonah Magnus]].
    - [[Conrad Lukas]]: A member of the [[Lukas Family]], who was responsible for the isolation study making up [[Carter Chilcott]]'s portion of the [[Daedalus]] mission.
    - [[Evan Lukas]]: A member of the [[Lukas Family]], set to be engaged to [[Naomi Herne]] before his untimely death.

# Artefacts

- [[A Disappearance]]: A [[List of Books|Leitner]] pamphlet that causes its reader to disappear if read to completion.
- [[Tadeas Dahl]]'s [[Boatswain's Call]]: Seems to have the ability to summon the Lonely.
- [[Lonely Painting]]: A drab English pastoral with the power to draw its viewer into The Lonely. Sold by [[Mikaele Salesa]].

# Locations

- [[Moorland House]]: The [[Lukas Family]]'s home in Kent.
- The Tundra: [[Peter Lukas]]' ship.
- The Lonely: A separate, foggy dimension that is absent of any life, with the exception of any victims sent there. It is most commonly accessed by the Lukas', who use it both for their own benefits and the removal of victims, who lose themselves within the domain. It is the direct manifestation of the Entity itself, thus is capable of appearing on its own accord.
- [[The House Domain]]: A large building filled with fog and faceless wanderers. Victims within are unable to accurately recall anything that may have once brought them comfort or safety.
- [[Martin's Domain]]: A domain that is a mix of the Lonely and [[The Eye]]. Inhabited by a few people who fear that no one will ever know of them, that they shall suffer in silence, and be mourned by nobody.
- [[The Suburb]]: A domain in the post-[[The Change|Change]] world theorised to feed off the fear of secret domestic abuse, as suggest by clues such as "But if you think there’s a lack of violence or suffering, then I’m afraid you’re mistaken," "the suffering here is deep. And it’s private." [[Jonathan Sims|John]] and [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] passed through it on their way to London. [[Herman Gorgoli]] was trapped in a similarly sprawling, empty suburb in [[MAG 150]], with identical beige houses lining bland, interchangeable streets.

# Ritual

[[Peter Lukas]] orchestrated a ritual for the Lonely, naming it "[[The Silence]]." He commissioned a tower block designed to isolate its inhabitants and filled it with people predisposed to loneliness. For the culmination of the ritual, he planned to lock them in and leave them to die. The ritual was disrupted by community outreach programs and think pieces after [[Gertrude Robinson]] tipped off _The Guardian_ newspaper.

# Connections with other Entities

- The [[Lukas Family]] provides funding to [[The Magnus Institute]], so it is possible that the Lonely is aligned with [[The Eye]] in some manner.
    - [[Peter Lukas]] acted as the interim Head of the Institute while [[Elias Bouchard]] was in prison.
    - In [[MAG 159]], [[Jonathan Sims|John]] says that the Lonely is powerless if people don't know how alone they are.
- [[Jonah Magnus]] and [[Mordechai Lukas]] were also apparently good friends, and it is possible that the [[Lukas Family]] may also have been acquainted with [[Maxwell Rayner]] and [[Robert Smirke]].
- Like [[The Fairchilds]] with [[The Vast]], the Lukases have been serving their entity for at least two centuries. However, "Fairchild" is apparently an assumed name, whereas the Lukases marry "spooky singles" and bear children with them.
    - While speaking with [[Martin Blackwood]], [[Simon Fairchild]], an avatar of [[The Vast]], implies that the Lonely and [[The Vast]] may have a mutually beneficial relationship, based on the grounds that being alone often makes the space you're in feel larger and very empty, while, conversely, the larger a space you're in, the easier it is to feel alone.
- The Lonely, [[The Desolation]], and [[The Dark]] are all associated with cults. The [[Lukas Family]] is described by [[Evan Lukas]] as very "religious", [[The Desolation]] has [[The Cult of the Lightless Flame]], and [[The Dark]] has [[The People's Church of the Divine Host]]. Additionally, the descriptions of locations (particularly churches) magically changing to other locations appear to be connected to both the Lonely and [[The Dark]].
    - The [[Lukas Family]] teamed up with both The Fairchilds and [[The People's Church of the Divine Host]] to send their avatars and victims to space aboard _[[The Daedalus]]._
- The Lonely and [[The Buried]] seem to have several features in common. In [[MAG 13]], [[Naomi Herne]] describes the second half of her experience in ways more commonly associated with [[The Buried]]: thick fog pressing in and making it hard to breathe, open graves trying to suck her in, frequent mentions of dirt and pressure, and lost time/memories. In [[MAG 48]], [[Andrea Nunis]] describes being thirsty and hot in a manner reminiscent of the suffering from [[The Buried]] in [[MAG 66]] and [[MAG 132]]. (And, interestingly, [[Peter Lukas]] appears in [[MAG 66]] at the end of Vincent's ordeal.)
    - Conversely, [[MAG 2]], [[MAG 15]], [[MAG 71]], and [[MAG 129]] all describe ways [[The Buried]] isolated the statement givers, such as [[Joshua]] living completely alone in a large building, [[Laura and Kulbir]] being separated from their sisters, and several lone travellers being taken on the night train by [[The Buried]].
    - Anchors also seem to be effective in defeating both the Lonely and [[The Buried]]. [[Andrea Nunis|Andrea]] survives her experience by thinking of her mother as [[Gerry]] advised in a way similar to Kulbir's anchoring to his grandfather via the knife.
- [[Annabelle Cane]] and [[The Web]] planned on having [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] join them but his allegiance to The Lonely partially prevented them.
- The Lonely and [[The Dark]] both appear to have the ability to block [[The Eye]]'s perception.
    - [[Jurgen Leitner|Leitner]] uses [[A Disappearance]] to hide from [[Elias Bouchard]] while living in the old [[Millbank Prison]] tunnels. In [[MAG 170]], [[Jonathan Sims]] claims that it was harder to find [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]] through the Lonely domain.
    - Places associated with [[The Dark]] such as [[Ny-Ålesund]] are difficult for [[Johnathan Sims|John]] and [[Elias Bouchard|Elias]] to properly know about.
- The Lonely, [[The Vast]] and [[The Buried]] are the only [[The Entities|Entities]] that can manifest themselves as separate realms.

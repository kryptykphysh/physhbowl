# History

During her first year of university at Oxford, she and her friend Alex encountered a group of people in the Medical Sciences Building who were supposedly protesters but appeared to have all collapsed on the floor. The only person sitting up was a woman that Alex knew as one of the cadavers used in anatomy classes. The dead woman whispered something to Alex, who then joined the rest of the group in lying motionless on the floor. She whispered to Georgie, who tried not to hear, but she was unable to block out the phrase: "The moment that you die will feel exactly the same as this one."

Georgie later woke up in her bed, having been there for several days, and could no longer feel anything. She took a year off from university to recover, and never saw Alex again.

Due to this experience, Georgie no longer feels fear. She is unsure whether her fear was cauterized or stolen from her.

Georgie returned to Oxford (presumably Balliol College specifically), where she met [[Jonathan Sims|John]]. The two dated for some time before parting on less than ideal terms.

She eventually started the _[[What The Ghost?]]_ podcast and befriended [[Melanie King]]. She had previously worked with [[Sarah Baldwin]] on two occasions and put Melanie in touch with her when she needed a sound engineer.

In 2017 she lets [[Jonathan Sims]] live in her apartment while he is suspected of murdering [[Jurgen Leitner]], and at least once during that time she lies to the police about his whereabouts.

As of [[MAG 157: Rotten Core]], Georgie and [[Melanie King|Melanie]] are romantically involved and living together.

## Season Five

When [[The Change]] happens Georgie, along with [[Melanie King|Melanie]], remains unaffected. They make their way to the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]], figuring [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]] [[Jonathan Sims|John]] will know what is going on, but by the time they arrive, the world has fully turned and the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]] is inaccessible. With nowhere to go, [[Melanie King|Melanie]] brings them into the tunnels beneath the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]], which still seem to offer some protection from [[The Eye]].

Over time, they pull some people out of nearby domains and unintentionally form a cult of sorts.

They find out about [[Jonathan Sims|John]] and [[Martin Blackwood|Martin's]] return to London as the entire city is excited about the [[Archivist]] arriving. They find the two of them by the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]] and bring them into the tunnels.

Once [[Jonathan Sims|Jon]], [[Martin Blackwood|Martin]], and [[Basira Hussain|Basira]] return after speaking with [[Annabelle Cane]] on [[Hilltop Road]], Georgie tricks [[Jonathan Sims|Jon]] into giving her the [[Web Lighter]]. In the plan to destroy the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]] and push [[The Entities]] out of reality, Georgie distracts the past archivists while [[Melanie King|Melanie]] ignites the gas main beneath the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]].

# Recurring Nightmares

Since giving her statement to [[Jonathan Sims|John]] in [[MAG 94: Dead Woman Walking]], Georgie has recurring dreams about being in a dissection room. Unlike most characters with recurring nightmares, Georgie does not appear to be scared or upset by hers. She just looks right back at the watcher in pity.

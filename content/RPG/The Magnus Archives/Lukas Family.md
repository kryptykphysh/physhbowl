 The Lukas family are recurring people in the Cases of The Magnus Archives. They are a major source of funding for [[The Magnus Institute]]. They appear to be very wealthy, as they own or fund various companies or ventures, including the _Tundra_ cargo ship and the space station [[Daedalus]].

They are a family dedicated to serving [[The Lonely]] and have a family house, Moorland House, in Kent where they have their own graveyard. A piece of one of the gravestones was picked up by [[Naomi Herne]], which had the word "Forgotten" on it, and the team were unable to trace its origin.

# Known Members

## Aaron Lukas

Brother of [[Peter Lukas]]. Lacked the temperament to serve [[The Lonely]] and was sent away to live with distant relatives.

## Conrad Lukas

Conrad Lukas was one of the scientists who carried out experiments on the effects of isolation on the privately-owned [[Daedalus|Daedalus Space Station]].

## Evan Lukas

Evan Lukas was estranged from his family. He and his fiancée [[Naomi Herne]] fell in love shortly after meeting, although he unexpectedly died on 22nd March 2015 from an undiagnosed "one in a million chance" congenital heart problem. [[Naomi Herne|Naomi]] later attended his funeral the following March 30th at the Lukas family house, where she met members of his family for the first time, who promptly ushered her away; she had a supernatural encounter on her way back from the Lukas family house, but managed to survive, sustaining only light injuries from being hit by a car.

## Judith Lukas

Sister of [[Peter Lukas]]. Lacked the temperament to serve [[The Lonely]] and was sent away to live with distant relatives.

## Mordechai Lukas

Mordechai Lukas was an associate of [[Robert Smirke]] and one of the individuals entrusted with [[Robert Smirke|Smirke's]] knowledge of [[The Entities]]. He was presumably the first Lukas to fall to [[The lonely]].

On April 9th, 1824 Mordechai Lukas trapped [[Barnabas Bennett]] in an alternate reality of which he was the sole inhabitant as retribution for [[Barnabas Bennett|Barnabas']] refusal to repay a debt. Objects within this reality could be affected by those in the primary reality and vice-versa, as [[Barnabas Bennett|Barnabas]] noted certain items being moved or broken without his involvement, but those inhabiting the parallel realities could not perceive or interact with one another. [[Barnabas Bennett|Bennett]] was able to use this to his advantage and left a letter begging for help addressed to [[Jonah Magnus]] - which, unfortunately for [[Barnabas Bennett|Bennett]], went ignored. Mordechai Lukas was allegedly "on good terms" with [[Jonah Magnus]].

## Nathaniel Lukas

Nathaniel Lukas is the founder and majority owner of Solus Shipping PLC, the owners of the _Tundra._ He was also one of the major investors in the Stratosphere Group, which carried out experiments on the effects of isolation on their privately owned [[Daedalus|Daedalus Space Station]].

## [[Peter Lukas]]

Peter Lukas is the captain of the ship _The Tundra_. When [[Elias Bouchard]] is removed as head of the [[The Magnus Institute|Institute]], he steps in to take over day-to-day management of the Archives.

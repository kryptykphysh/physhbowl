 I tried to get a couple of AI agents to collate all the scandals and shitfuckery Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast have done over the past few years, but it proved almost impossible to get any output from them that expressed an opinion or disapproval. So, because I can't be arsed writing it myself, here's a milquetoast, "objective and factual," breakdown from an AI source:
 > Dungeons & Dragons, a beloved tabletop RPG, has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. However, behind the scenes, controversies involving its parent companies, Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast (WotC), have sparked concern and outrage among fans. Are these controversies just growing pains, or are they indicative of deeper issues that could threaten the game's future?  
>
> One of the most significant controversies revolves around the **Open Game License (OGL)**. The OGL allowed third-party creators to publish content compatible with D&D, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of supplements and adventures. WotC's attempt to revise the OGL in late 2022/early 2023 was met with fierce opposition. The proposed changes were seen as restrictive and aimed at maximizing profits, potentially stifling creativity and harming the third-party market that had become integral to D&D's success. The backlash was significant, with many creators threatening to move to other systems. While WotC eventually backtracked somewhat, the damage to their reputation was considerable.  
>
> Adding fuel to the fire was the alleged **use of Pinkerton agents**. Reports surfaced that WotC (or Hasbro) sent Pinkerton agents to the home of a YouTuber who had leaked information about upcoming products. This heavy-handed tactic was widely criticized as an overreaction and an attempt to intimidate a member of the community. It raised concerns about WotC's approach to communication and their willingness to engage with fans.
>
> Further criticism has been leveled at WotC regarding their treatment of creators. Allegations have arisen about **firing creators shortly before Christmas**, leaving them without income during the holiday season. Concerns have also been raised about **lack of proper credit for creators in official D&D publications**, diminishing their contributions and potentially hindering their careers. These actions have fostered a sense of distrust and resentment within the creative community.
>
> The use of **AI-generated artwork** in some D&D products has also drawn criticism. Many artists feel that this practice devalues their work and undermines the artistic integrity of the game. The debate surrounding AI art in creative fields is complex, but its inclusion in D&D has further alienated some members of the community.  
>
> Finally, the **licensing of D&D to online casinos** has raised eyebrows among some fans. This move is seen by some as a purely profit-driven decision that cheapens the game's image and potentially exposes younger players to gambling. It raises questions about WotC's priorities and whether they are prioritizing short-term gains over the long-term health of the D&D brand.
>
> These controversies paint a picture of a company seemingly out of touch with its community and prioritizing profit over the well-being of its creators and fans. While D&D remains popular, the long-term impact of these controversies remains to be seen. Will WotC learn from these mistakes and rebuild trust with its community? Or will these actions ultimately damage the game that so many people love? Only time will tell.

Yes, I know most corporations are motivated by a profit motive and are accountable to shareholders, blah blah blah. That happens. However, your money is your vote under capitalism. I'm not voting for this shite.
